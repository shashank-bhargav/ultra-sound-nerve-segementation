# ultrasound-nerve-segmentation
Segmentation of Ultrasound Nerve Images using Keras for the contest hosted by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation">Kaggle</a>

<ul>
  <li> The U-net architecture is inspired from the paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597">U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation.</a>
   <li> Most of the preprocessing is taken from Jocic Marko's <a href="https://github.com/jocicmarko/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation">implementation</a>
  <li> This implementation uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167">Batchnormalisation</a> for accelerated training.
